\description{
Generic function for training word embeddings using the Skip-Gram with Negative
Sampling (SGNS) algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013). Supports both streaming from
tokens (fast, like word2vec) and training from pre-computed FCMs (consistent
with other methods in this package).
}
\details{
\strong{Streaming from tokens (\code{train_sgns.tokens})}: Fast implementation that
processes the text stream directly, similar to word2vec. Requires a \code{context_spec}
to define the context window.

\strong{Training from FCM (\code{train_sgns.fcm})}: Trains from pre-computed co-occurrence
counts. Useful when you want to use the same FCM for multiple algorithms or
apply FCM transformations.
