\usage{
fcm(
  x,
  window = 5L,
  weights = "linear",
  weights_args = list(),
  distance_metric = c("words", "characters", "surprisal"),
  direction = "symmetric",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A quanteda \code{tokens} object.}

\item{window}{Size of the context window (in words) on either side of the target word.}

\item{weights}{Either a string specifying a decay function of distance ("linear", "harmonic", "exponential", "power", or "none") or a numeric vector of weights. If a vector, its length must be equal to \code{window} (if \code{include_target = FALSE}) or \code{window + 1} (if \code{include_target = TRUE}) for one-sided context, or \code{2 * window} / \code{2 * window + 1} for two-sided context.}

\item{weights_args}{List of arguments for the decay function (e.g. \code{alpha} for power/exp).}

\item{distance_metric}{Metric to input to decay function: "words", "characters", "surprisal". "words" uses token distance; "characters" weights words by their length in characters; "surprisal" weights words by -log(probability) based on unigram frequencies. Metrics are rescaled such that the average width of a word is fixed at 1 (i.e. \code{window = 5} will result in an average window size of 5 words).}

\item{direction}{String ("symmetric", "forward", "backward") or numeric ratio of forward to backward weight.}

\item{tri}{Logical. If TRUE, return only the upper triangle (if symmetric).}

\item{vocab_size}{Optional. Limit vocabulary to top N most frequent types.}

\item{vocab_coverage}{Optional. Limit vocabulary to cover this proportion of tokens.}

\item{vocab_keep}{Optional character vector of types to keep.}

\item{include_target}{Logical. If TRUE, the target word is included in the context (distance 0).}

\item{verbose}{Logical.}

\item{threads}{Integer. Number of threads to use for parallel processing. If NULL (default), uses all available cores.}
